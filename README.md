# E-COMMERCE TRAINEES-SUBSCRIPTIONS ANALYSIS

## Project overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insight into the trainees rate of sucbscrption and unsubscrption from different countries. By analysing this data we seek to identify trends, correlations, make data-driven decisions and recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of the country(s) that is greatly subscibing to the training and with and which country has the least subscriptions and what could be the factors leading to that. This is to help us to be able to make clear decions and set possible data driven decisions on how we can increase and maintain our subscribers.


### Data Source
Subscription data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "trainess_data.cvs" file, containing deatailed information about country's subscription to the training.

### Tools Used
-Excel - Data cleaning, Data analysis and visualization [Downlaod_here](https://microsoft.com)


### Data Cleaning/ Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were prformed:
1. The data was loaded and inspected.
2. Data Cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA Involved the training data to answer key questions, such as:
- How many countries are under our subscription?
- What is the number of subsribers from each country?
- What is the number of active and inactive subsribers from each country?
- What are their age groups?
- Waht are their occupations and gender?
- What are their salary ranges?

### RESULTS AND FINDING
The analysis results are sumarised as follows:
 
1. France has the highest number of active memebers to the training  with a total number of 47627 active members while Geramany has the least number of active subscribers to the training.
2. The youth are more of the training active members in france.
3. Male youth are more of the active members in the training.

### Recommendation
Based on the analysis, We recommend the following:
- Focus on market audience of the youth.
- Invest in marketing in Germany to get more subscribers from there.
- More engagement with female youth is highly needed through marketing.

### Limitations
I had to remove most of the wild cards that were within the names of the clients.
This did not affect the results in anyway.
I also had to remove the outliers since they would affect the accurancy of my results.
